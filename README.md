This auction site will allow users to create auction listings for items they want to sell. 
This auction site will allow users to create auction listings for items they want to sell. When creating an auction, the user will specify the name of the item, the starting price, and the auction duration (which will be fixed at 3 days).

Once the auction is created, other users can place bids on the item, by specifying the auction ID and the bid amount. The highest bidder at the end of the auction period will be the winner and will be able to purchase the item for the final bid price.

The site will be built on the Pi Network and will use the Ethereum network for transaction handling and smart contract deployment. The code will be compatible with web3 wallet extensions, such as MetaMask, to allow users to interact with the Ethereum network.

The code will also handle errors, events, and UI updates. For example, when an auction is created, an event will be fired that will trigger an update in the user interface to show the newly created auction. Similarly, when a bid is placed, an event will be fired that will update the bid information in the user interface.

Overall, this auction site will provide an easy-to-use platform for buying and selling items, where transactions are secure and transparent, and the outcome of the auction is determined by the blockchain.
